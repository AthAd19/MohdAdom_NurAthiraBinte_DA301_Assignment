The study hopes to answer the following questions:

- how customers accumulate loyalty points
> relation to Spending, Remuneration, Age [Python 1]
    > built on LP v Remuneration relationship by using S-R clusters <br>
    > to continue investigation if time permits
- how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments
> 5 clusters identified within customer base based in remuneration and spending_score [Python 2] <br>
    > Cluster yet to be labelled and categorised (besides by remuneration & spending) 
- how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns
> Sentiment analysis started <br>
> Word loud, sentiment polarity chart created [Python 3]  <br> 
> __[FOLLOW-UP]__ Actual sentiment analysis, business pov: marketing use
- the impact that each product has on sales
> Briefly explored, but difficult to make any significant insights [R 4]
- how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)
- what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales? 
> Briefly explored, but difficult to make any significant insights [R 4]
